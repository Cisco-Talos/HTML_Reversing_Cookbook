# HTML Reversing Cookbook

Welcome to the HTML Reversing Cookbook! This repository is a collection of CyberChef recipes for decoding and decrypting strings in HTML attachments. Whether you're a security professional, a developer, or just curious about reverse engineering, you'll find a variety of useful modules here.

[CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) is a powerful open-source web application developed by the [Government Communications Headquarters](https://www.gchq.gov.uk/) that facilitates the decoding and decryption of JavaScript code in HTML attachments. It provides a variety of modules (or functions) for decoding and decryption that can be combined to build a "recipe." These recipes can then be exported in different formats and loaded later for use elsewhere.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
HTML Reversing Cookbook is a project aimed at providing comprehensive recipes to decode and decrypt various obfuscated strings found in HTML files. Each recipe is a combination of one or more modules that implement different decoding, decryption and deobfuscation algorithms.

## Getting Started <a name="getstarted"></a>
To get started, simply clone this repository and explore the main directory for reversing recipes.

## Recipes <a name="recipes"></a>
All recipes, examples and detailed instructions can be found in this repository and will be updated over time.

## Contributing <a name="contributing"></a>
We welcome contributions from the community! If you have a secret recipe (like a secret Italian sauce :smiley:) to share or an improvement to suggest, please submit a pull request to the mirror repository [hosted here](https://github.com/OMirzaei/HTML_Reversing_Cookbook). Once the pull request is approved in the mirror repository, we will update the main repository of Cisco Talos as well.

This repository is maintained by one of my team members, [Sachin Shukla](https://github.com/sachin28).
